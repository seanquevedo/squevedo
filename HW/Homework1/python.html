                <p> C++ is an object-oriented programming language that allows you to work on high-level applications such as 
                web servers, operating systems, and modern game engines. All files end with the extension ".cpp" and are commonly compiled using a C++
                compiled named Gnu C Compiler (gcc/g++). </p>
                
                <p> C++ differs from other Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) languages because C++ is able to inherit multiple classes - known as "Multiple Inheritance".
                Aside from that, C++ is known to be fast and efficient for programming. </p>
                
                <p> In the example shown, you can identify the most common elements of a programming language.
                A standard library(include <iostream>), the main method(int main()), and the function to output(cout <<)!
                This sample code simulates a login interaction from a user's input. </p>
