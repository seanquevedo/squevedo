                <p> Like C++, Java is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language. Java is known for it's garbage collection - this feature
                destroys objects that are no longer in use when running a program. Java is also known for using single class, hierarchical inheritance.
                Although Java's speed is slow, it is very efficient to program for rigorous applications.</p>
                
                <br />
                
                <p> Java's syntax to declare or print variables are not very easy to follow, but the syntax to create methods and classes are easy to follow and organized. </p>
                
                <br />
                
                <p> In the example shown, you can identify the most common elements of a programming language:
                <br /><strong>A standard library --> </strong><code>import java.util.Scanner;</code>,<br /> <strong>the main method --> </strong><code>public static void main(String[] args) {}</code>, <br /><strong>and the function to output --> </strong><code>System.out.println("Hello");</code> 
                <br />
                This sample code simulates a restaurant instance that outputs a request to the chef of how many pieces of chicken are left over or need to be made. </p>
